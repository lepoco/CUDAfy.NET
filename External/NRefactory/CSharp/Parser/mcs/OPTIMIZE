This document describes all code optimalizations performed by Mono C# compiler
when optimalizations are enabled via /optimize+ option.

Optimalizations:

* Instance field initializer to default value
---------------------------------------------

Code to optimize:

class C
{
    enum E
    {
	Test
    }
    
    int i = 0;  // Field will not be redundantly assigned
    int i2 = new int (); // This will be also completely optimized out
    
    E e = E.Test; // Even this will go out.
    
}
